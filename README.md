# Real-time Vehicle Detection and Traffic Analysis System for Malaysia Rest & Recreation (R&R) Stops
## Description of the system:
- using RF-Detr Base model (roboflow's) for detecting and classifying vehicles entering and exiting the R&R stops from surveillance footage (video file or live camera feed) into sedan, SUV, pickup, van, motorcycle, bus or truck.
- track (using bytetrack) and count (once the vehicle crosses a user-defined line), and calculate the people flow (using the data of the min and max seat capacity of each vehicle type). E,g,. Sedan - min = 1, max = 5.
- after user uploaded or selected the surveillance footage, user will be prompt to draw the line on first frame extracted.
- The data is logged, saved to Firebase, and displayed in the dashboard. 
- Include: key performance indicators that summarise the current state (including an estimated on-site people range (expressed as a bounded interval) and net vehicle movement derived from inbound and outbound counts), visualisation of the historical data in charts, and might include a prediction on the people flow in the future
- The annotated vehicle dataset is using one found from Roboflow (imbalanced classes, will improve in the future), include the 7 classes: sedan, SUV, pickup, van, motorcycle, bus or truck.
- Will deployed using Flask and Firebase Realtime Database.


### Seat-Capacity Mapping:

| Vehicle Type | Seat Capacity |
|--------------|---------------|
| Sedan        | 1–5           |
| SUV          | 1–8           |
| Pickup       | 1–6           |
| Van          | 1–15          |
| Bus          | 1–50          |
| Truck        | 1–3           |
| Motorcycle   | 1–2           |

## Plan

Proposed UI/UX: "The Analyst Workbench"
Instead of a static dashboard, treat the page as a workspace with two states.

**Layout Strategy**
- Left Sidebar (Collapsible): This replaces the "Setup Page." It holds the inputs for Video Source and Camera Role.

- Center Stage (The Player): A large video container that toggles between "Raw Video" (for drawing lines) and "Processed Stream" (for viewing results).

- Bottom/Right Panel: The Analytics (Charts, Logs) that update as the video plays.

**State 1: Configuration Mode (Default on Load)**
- Sidebar: Open. User sees "Upload Video" and "Camera Role: Entry/Exit".

- Center: Shows the First Frame of the video.

- Action: User draws the line directly on this frame.

- Button: A large "Start Analysis" button is visible.

**State 2: Analysis Mode (After Clicking Start)**
- Sidebar: Automatically collapses or switches to "Job Status" (Progress bar).

- Center: Switches to the Processed Video Feed (showing bounding boxes).

- Action: The user watches the analysis.

- Button: "Stop/Edit" button appears to return to State 1
